# 💫 About Me:
🔭 I’m currently working on<br>Building intelligent systems the way an AI agent would in a sci-fi movie—taking messy, incomplete information and slowly figuring out what actually matters. Think of the early scenes in Iron Man, where JARVIS helps Tony Stark test ideas, fail safely, and improve step by step.<br><br>👯 I’m looking to collaborate on<br>Problems that don’t come with clear instructions like in Inception, where the rules of the world reveal themselves only after you start experimenting. I enjoy working on things where understanding the problem is half the challenge.<br><br>🤝 I’m looking for help with<br>Learning how to think ahead like seasoned characters in movies, the ones who pause, question assumptions, and redesign the plan before everything collapses. Basically, avoiding the classic “this should work” moment that comes right before disaster.<br><br>🌱 I’m currently learning<br>How machines make decisions, how humans design those decisions, and why both sometimes fail confidently. Similar to Interstellar, where intelligence isn’t just about equations, but about understanding limits, uncertainty, and trade-offs.<br><br>💬 Ask me about<br>AI and machine learning basics, problem-solving approaches, debugging logic, or why many bugs exist simply because the system interpreted the world differently than the developer expected, very much like an AI agent misreading its environment.<br><br>⚡ Fun fact<br>I often feel like an AI character during debugging scenes in movies—running perfectly logical steps, discovering a hidden assumption, and realising the mistake only after replaying the entire sequence in my head… twice.
